This is a front-end web project designed for an E-Learning platform, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this project is to simulate a professional online learning platform with essential user-facing features, responsive design, and a clean layout, similar to platforms like Udemy or Coursera.

#Features

Responsive Navigation Bar
Includes a simple, fixed navbar with branding and accessible Login and Signup buttons that open modal forms.

Hero Section
A visually appealing header section with a strong call to action, encouraging users to explore available courses.

Popular Courses Grid
A section displaying a list of popular courses in a grid layout, course title, short description, and enroll button. Each course is categorized (e.g., Web, Python, Java) for easy filtering.

Course Filtering
Users can filter displayed courses based on category using a dropdown menu. This helps demonstrate basic DOM manipulation with JavaScript.

Video Embedding
Includes a section to preview course videos using embedded YouTube links, allowing users to get a feel for the course content.

Progress Tracking (UI Only)
A static progress bar is included to show how much of a course a user has completed. While it's not dynamic, it gives an idea of how learning progress could be visualized.

Modals for Login/Signup
Simple modal forms for user login and registration, created using basic HTML/CSS/JS without external libraries.

Clean & Professional Styling
Designed with CSS grid, transitions, and hover effects to offer a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.
